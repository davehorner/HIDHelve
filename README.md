Horner's HIDHelve - handle your human interface device.

###What's a Helve?
 helve /helv/
 noun - The handle of a weapon or tool.
 
###What is HIDHelve?
 HIDHelve listens to your USB HID devices for state changes and publishes that data in a variety of ways.
 It's useful in automating some work to be done when smashing buttons.
 Every tool or weapon you write shouldn't have to interface directly with the low level HID libraries.
 HIDHelve decouples you from direct HID manipulation.
